max-w-none text-lg"><p>We're proud to announce the first release candidate of Nullstack, after ~4 years of development and over 3 years being used in real-life, production projects.</p>
<p>Every time we thought about officially releasing a 1.0 version, we got more feature requests from our small community and postponed the release to implement them.
We believe we’ve reached a pretty solid, complete state in terms of both our API and the core functionalities.
We finally reached the point where, for a few weeks, our Github repo has no open issues and we are running out of excuses not to launch it.</p>
<p>For those new here: Nullstack is a full stack Javascript framework that aims to facilitate the process of quickly building MVPs with quality and scalability by allowing developers to plug-and-play isomorphic features into the code base seamlessly. We aim to be product-focused and feature-driven, although the framework is flexible enough to allow pretty much any design pattern you would like to use.</p>
<p>Nullstack is just vanilla Javascript that reacts to your changes both on the client and server side. It allows you to build pretty much anything: from PWAs with ssr to hybrid mobile applications and even Google Chrome extensions backed by microservices within the same codebase.</p>
<p>One cool thing about Nullstack is that we value <strong>not</strong> having Nullstack-specific notation, which means it supports any default HTML tag, such as an <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> for links. The framework handles it just fine, without going out of SPA mode just because of it. We also support the normal HTML attributes such as <code>class</code> and <code>onclick</code>, and we support any vanilla JS library that exists, relying on the already robust JavaScript and Node ecosystem, so that a developer wouldn't need to learn anything new to be able to start using it.</p>
<p>You can learn more about our very comprehensive set of features in our <a href="https://nullstack.app/getting-started" target="_blank" rel="noopener">documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Apart from personal and freelancing projects, we've also been using Nullstack for the past year at <a href="https://ae.studio/work" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AE Studio</a> on both <a href="https://instillvideo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">skunkworks projects with thousands of users</a> and <a href="https://www.areyouonpoint.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">client projects</a>, to a point where we even made it part of our <a href="https://ae.studio/jobs/4484720004/nullstack-developer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">onboarding process</a>. We're pretty adamant about how much it not only allows us to speed up the development process, but also the quality of life for developers and a more adaptable product to our clients.</p>
<p>So, without further ado, we invite everyone to give it a try: all you need to do is run <code>npx create-nullstack-app@latest project-name</code> and start having fun! 🎉</p>
