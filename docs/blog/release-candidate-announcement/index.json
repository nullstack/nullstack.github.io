We aim to be product-focused and feature-driven, although the framework is flexible enough to allow pretty much any design pattern you would like to use.<\\/p>\n<p>Nullstack is just vanilla Javascript that reacts to your changes both on the client and server side. It allows you to build pretty much anything: from PWAs with ssr to hybrid mobile applications and even Google Chrome extensions backed by microservices within the same codebase.<\\/p>\n<p>One cool thing about Nullstack is that we value <strong>not<\\/strong> having Nullstack-specific notation, which means it supports any default HTML tag, such as an <code>&lt;a&gt;<\\/code> for links. The framework handles it just fine, without going out of SPA mode just because of it. We also support the normal HTML attributes such as <code>class<\\/code> and <code>onclick<\\/code>, and we support any vanilla JS library that exists, relying on the already robust JavaScript and Node ecosystem, so that a developer wouldn't need to learn anything new to be able to start using it.<\\/p>\n<p>You can learn more about our very comprehensive set of features in our <a href=\"https://nullstack.app/getting-started\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">documentation<\\/a>.<\\/p>\n<p>Apart from personal and freelancing projects, we've also been using Nullstack for the past year at <a href=\"https://ae.studio/work\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AE Studio<\\/a> on both <a href=\"https://instillvideo.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">skunkworks projects with thousands of users<\\/a> and <a href=\"https://www.areyouonpoint.co/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">client projects<\\/a>, to a point where we even made it part of our <a href=\"https://ae.studio/jobs/4484720004/nullstack-developer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">onboarding process<\\/a>. We're pretty adamant about how much it not only allows us to speed up the development process, but also the quality of life for developers and a more adaptable product to our clients.<\\/p>\n<p>So, without further ado, we invite everyone to give it a try: all you need to do is run <code>npx create-nullstack-app@latest project-name<\\/code> and start having fun! ðŸŽ‰<\\/p>\n<p>If you have any questions, feel free to join our <a href=\"https://discord.com/invite/eDZfKz264v\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Discord server<\\/a> where you can interact with our community ðŸ¥°<\\/p>\n<p>Found a bug or have a feature request?
