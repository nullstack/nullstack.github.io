> ðŸ“Œ You can watch a video tutorial on our [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l23z00GEar8&list=PL5ylYELQy1hyFbguVaShp3XujjdVXLpId).

Create full stack JavaScript applications within seconds using `npx` to generate your project files from the latest template.

> ðŸ”¥ The minimum required [node.js](https://nodejs.org) version for development mode is *12.20.0*.

Replace `project-name` with your project name and run the command below to start a project: 

```sh
npx create-nullstack-app@latest project-name
```

> ðŸ’¡ You can use a CLI to select the blank javascript or typescript template or select the template with tailwind css.

Change directory to the generated folder:

```sh
cd project-name
```

Install the dependencies:

```sh
npm install # or yarn
```

Start the application in development mode:

```sh
npm start # or yarn start
```

## Understanding the generated files

The following folders and files will be generated:

### server.js

This is the server entry and generator point.

It is a convenient place to set up global things like [database](/how-to-use-mongodb-with-nullstack) and manipulate server `context`, details in [application startup](/application-startup).

### client.js

This is the client entry and generator point.

It is a convenient place to import global dependencies like CSS frameworks and manipulate client `context`.

### src/

This folder will contain the actual source code of your application.

### src/Application.jsx

This is your application main file.

>âœ¨ Learn more about the [jsx elements](/jsx-elements "Nullstack JavaScript").

When you run `npm start` it is consumed in **server**/**client** JS files by their `Nullstack.start` function, which starts and returns both [`context`](/context), that you can use to set up things like [database](/how-to-use-mongodb-with-nullstack) using [settings](/context-settings) and [secrets](/context-secrets).

>âœ¨ Learn more about the [application startup](/application-startup).

#### TypeScript

You can use Nullstack with TypeScript, just rename `njs` to `nts` or `jsx` to `tsx`.

### src/Application.css

This is an empty file just to demonstrate that you can use [CSS with Nullstack](/styles).

It is a good practice to import a style file in a component with the same name.

>âœ¨ Learn more about [styles](/styles).

### public/

Every file in here will be available to anyone from the domain root.

By default `create-nullstack-app` generates the icons required for your **manifest.json** and images for OG meta tags.

>âœ¨ Learn more about [manifest.json](/context-project).

Be sure to replace these images with your project identity.

### .development/

This is the compiled result of your application in development mode.

> ðŸ”¥ Do not touch this folder

### .production/

This is the compiled result of your application in production mode.

> ðŸ”¥ Do not touch this folder
